## Functional Requirerements

The company wants to invest in owning their infrastructure.
The reason is because there is a concern about thep rivacy of user
data and also a concern that the cost of managed services for GenAI
wil greatly increase in cost.

They want to invest an AI PC where they can afford to spend 10-15K.
They have 300 active students located mainly in the city of Nagasaki.

## Assumptions

We are assuming that the Open-Source LLMs that we choose will be powerful
enough to run on hardware with an investment of 10-15K

We're just going to hook up a single server in our office to the internet
and we should have enough bandwidth to serve the 300 students.

## Data

There is a concern of copyrighted materials, so we must purchase and
supply materials and store them for access in our database.
